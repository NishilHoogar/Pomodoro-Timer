# Cozy Pomodoro Timer 

Hi there! Welcome to my little corner of productivity.

This is a simple, hand-drawn style Pomodoro timer designed to make focus sessions feel a little less rigid and a lot more cozy. I wanted something that felt organic—like a doodle in a notebook—rather than a strict digital clock.

##  Features

*   **Balloon Presets:** Pick your focus time by clicking on floating balloons (5, 10, 15, or 25 minutes).
*   **Custom Timer:** Need a specific time? You can dial in your own minutes and seconds.
*   **Cozy Aesthetics:** Pastel colors, organic shapes, and a "hand-drawn" interface using the Indie Flower font.
*   **Focus & Break:** A clear timer screen to keep you on track, and a celebration screen when you've earned your break.
*   **Audio:** Plays a sound when the timer completes (make sure you have your volume up!).

##  How to Run

Since this is a simple web project, you don't need to install any heavy dependencies.

1.  Clone or download this folder.
2.  Make sure you have an internet connection (it uses Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts via CDN).
3.  Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.

That's it!

##  Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **Tailwind CSS** (for layout and utility classes)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (for the timer logic)
*   **Google Fonts** (Indie Flower)

##  Notes

I built this to have a "soft" interface. You'll notice the buttons tilt slightly when you hover over them, and the balloons float gently. It's the little things that make work easier!

Enjoy your focus session!
